## Whisper Transcription Issues

### Issue 1: Unsupported Parameters in ASR Pipeline

When running the tests, we encountered errors with unsupported parameters in the ASR pipeline:

```
Error transcribing audio: _sanitize_parameters() got an unexpected keyword argument 'language'
```

And later:

```
Error transcribing audio: _sanitize_parameters() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prompt'
```

And finally:

```
Error transcribing audio: _sanitize_parameters() got an unexpected keyword argument 'no_speech_threshold'
```

#### Solution:

The version of transformers being used in the project has a more limited set of parameters for the Whisper model than expected. We simplified the pipeline call to only use supported parameters:

```python
result = self.asr_pipeline(
    {"raw": processed_audio, "sampling_rate": sample_rate},
    max_new_tokens=256            # Increased for longer utterances
)
```

### Issue 2: Function Scope Problem in Test

The test was trying to access a function that was defined within another function, which was not accessible:

```
KeyError: 'filter_hallucinations'
```

#### Solution:

We moved the `filter_hallucinations` function from being defined inside the `transcribe` method to the module level, making it globally accessible for testing.

### Issue 3: Fallback for Older Transformers Versions

To ensure compatibility with different versions of the transformers library, we implemented a fallback mechanism for initializing the speech recognition model:

```python
# First try with the more modern parameter style
try:
    self.asr_pipeline = pipeline(
        "automatic-speech-recognition",
        model="openai/whisper-small",
        device=device
    )
    print(f"Speech recognition model loaded successfully on {device}")
except Exception as e:
    # Fall back to older style initialization if needed
    print(f"Warning: Modern initialization failed, trying legacy mode: {e}")
    # ... custom implementation ...
```

This makes the system more robust to different transformers versions.

### Issue 4: Parameter Mismatch in process_speech_with_sentiment Function

When running the server, we encountered repeated errors with the speech processing function:

```
Error in TensorFlow processing: process_speech_with_sentiment() takes from 1 to 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

#### Solution:

The function was being called with three parameters (`np_wav`, `pred_max_val`, `db`) but was defined to accept only one required parameter (`audio_data`) and one optional parameter (`sample_rate`). We fixed this by:

1. Updated all function calls to only pass the audio data parameter:
```python
sentiment_result = process_speech_with_sentiment(np_wav)
```

2. Modified the function definition to use the global `RATE` constant instead of accepting a sample rate parameter:
```python
def process_speech_with_sentiment(audio_data):
    # Function body using global RATE instead of sample_rate parameter
```

This ensures that the function is called with the correct number of parameters and properly uses the global sample rate setting.

## Documentation Updates

We also updated the documentation to accurately reflect the parameters that are actually supported by our version of the Whisper model:

1. Updated README.md with correct parameter information
2. Updated server/README.md with the simplified parameter set
3. Updated run_optimized_server.py to show accurate capabilities

## Test Results

After applying these fixes, the test script runs successfully:

- The model correctly rejects non-speech audio
- The hallucination filtering correctly detects and fixes repetitive patterns
- The model can transcribe real speech when tested

## Future Considerations

1. **Consider upgrading transformers**: A newer version of transformers might support more parameters for finer control over the Whisper model.
2. **Custom VAD**: We still have our custom voice activity detection which helps improve transcription quality regardless of model parameters.
3. **Post-processing**: Our text filtering functions effectively remove hallucinations even with limited model parameters.
