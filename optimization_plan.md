# Sound Recognition System Optimization Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to optimizing the SoundWatch sound recognition system. The plan focuses on three key areas:

1. **Model Architecture Improvements**: Implementing state-of-the-art architectures for better accuracy
2. **Inference Optimization**: Improving inference speed through quantization and efficient processing
3. **Data Processing Enhancements**: Optimizing audio preprocessing and feature extraction

## 1. Model Architecture Improvements

### 1.1 Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) Integration

The Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) has shown superior performance compared to CNN-based models like PANNs for audio classification tasks. Research shows that AST achieves state-of-the-art results of 0.485 mAP on AudioSet (compared to CNN's 0.431 mAP), 95.6% accuracy on ESC-50, and 98.1% accuracy on Speech Commands V2.

Implementation steps:
- Create a new module `ast_model_integration.py` that implements the AST model architecture
- Add configuration options to smoothly transition between CNN13 and AST models
- Implement the same API interface as the current PANNs model for seamless integration

### 1.2 Hybrid CNN-Transformer Approach

For optimal performance with reasonable computational requirements, we can implement a hybrid approach:
- Use CNN blocks for initial feature extraction (lower layers)
- Add transformer blocks for higher-level feature extraction and classification
- This combines the spatial pattern recognition of CNNs with the attention mechanisms of transformers

## 2. Inference Optimization

### 2.1 Model Quantization

Implement INT8 quantization to significantly improve inference speed while maintaining accuracy:

#### 2.1.1 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)
- Implement a calibration step during model loading that analyzes representative audio samples
- Convert FP32 weights to INT8 format with appropriate scaling factors
- Create a `quantize_model.py` utility for converting the model

#### 2.1.2 Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
- For models where PTQ results in accuracy drop, implement QAT
- Add simulated quantization nodes during training (fake quantization)
- Ensure model learns to be robust to quantization effects

### 2.2 ONNX Runtime Integration

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) provides a standardized format and runtime for optimized inference:
- Export PyTorch models to ONNX format
- Use ONNX Runtime for inference with hardware-specific optimizations
- Implement graph optimizations available in ONNX Runtime

### 2.3 TensorRT Acceleration for CUDA Devices

For systems with NVIDIA GPUs, integrate TensorRT for maximum performance:
- Create a TensorRT inference engine option in our pipeline
- Implement FP16 computation for GPUs that support it
- Use CUDA graphs to reduce kernel launch overhead

### 2.4 Batch Processing Optimization

Even for single audio samples, we can optimize processing:
- Implement optimized batch sizes for spectrogram processing
- Reduce memory allocations and copies
- Use pinned memory for faster CPU-GPU transfers

## 3. Data Processing Enhancements

### 3.1 Optimized Audio Preprocessing

Current audio preprocessing can be improved for better feature extraction:
- Optimize the mel spectrogram extraction pipeline
- Implement spectrum correction techniques for better noise handling
- Use better normalization techniques for varied audio sources

### 3.2 Advanced Data Augmentation

During model training, implement state-of-the-art audio augmentation techniques:
- SpecAugment: Apply time and frequency masking directly on spectrograms
- FilterAugment: Simulate various acoustic environments
- Adaptive normalization based on audio statistics

### 3.3 Multi-Format Feature Fusion

Combine multiple audio feature representations for better accuracy:
- Log Mel spectrograms (current approach)
- Log Gammatone spectrograms for better low-frequency representation
- MFCC for additional complementary features
- Implement feature fusion in the model architecture

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Inference Optimization (Short-term)
1. Implement ONNX export for the current CNN13 model
2. Add INT8 quantization with minimal code changes
3. Optimize the audio preprocessing pipeline

### Phase 2: Model Architecture Improvements (Medium-term)
1. Implement AST model as an alternative to CNN13
2. Create a hybrid CNN-Transformer model
3. Benchmark and compare performance across models

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Long-term)
1. Implement multi-format feature fusion
2. Create specialized models for different audio categories
3. Develop an ensemble approach for maximum accuracy

## 5. Performance Benchmarking

To ensure improvements are measurable, we will implement a comprehensive benchmarking system:
- Accuracy: mAP, Top-1, Top-5 accuracy on standard datasets
- Speed: Inference time per sample, samples per second
- Memory usage: Peak memory usage during inference
- Model size: Storage requirements for deployment

## 6. Conclusion

This optimization plan provides a roadmap for significantly improving the SoundWatch sound recognition system. By implementing these enhancements, we can achieve:
- Higher accuracy in detecting sounds (especially challenging categories)
- Faster inference times for better real-time performance
- Reduced resource requirements for better battery life and wider device compatibility
